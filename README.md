# Gabelentz, H. C. von Der. 1838–39: Versuch einer mordwinischen Grammatik.
Herr Conrad von Der Gabelentz's grammar is an erudite interpretation of grammatical phenomena to be found in the first Erzya translation of the Gospel published in 1821, i.e. this is the first bit of parallel corpus work in Erzya studies.


# Wiedemann, F. J. 1865: Grammatik der ersa-mordwinischen Sprache.
F. J. Wiedemann's grammar of Erzya is based on previous research work by Herr Conrad von Der Gabelentz (1838–39) and interviews with native speakers he had access to in  Reval (Tallinn). No fieldwork was conducted in the Erzya homeland.
